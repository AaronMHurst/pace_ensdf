Transient equilibrium
---------------------

This folder has been added to provide users with the option of using transient-equilibrium data and switching back and forth between the regular and transient-equilibrium datasets during installation.  The datasets in `regular` folder are the original `JSON` interpreted files from ENSDF.  In the `transient` folder, the corresponding files have been replaced with versions containing the transient equilibrium intensity values given in the comments of the ENSDF file for the respective `IT` decay modes.

This is an ongoing project and new datasets will gradually be added to the `transient` folder according to user needs.
